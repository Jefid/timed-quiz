# Timed-Quiz

## Purpose
A website that uses Javascript to present the user with a timed quiz on Javascript knowledge. The quiz is 60 seconds and will subtract 10 seconds from your time for every question missed. At the end of the test the user's time left will represent their score. They will have an option to store their score in localStorage with other highscores.

## Preview
Here is a mock-up of how the page looks and functions.
